      <p>Hey! I'm John, this is my page on the internet. My work background ranges from time spent in museums
        across New York City, in community organizing and social justice spaces, and at a public health center in
        Chinatown. I've since become increasingly fascinated with how fast technology can affect infrastructure that's
        been in place for decades in all aspects of public life. I learned the tools of software development at
        Fullstack Academy, and have been building different projects on my own to keep learning and growing. I hope to
        use everything I've
        learned to soon collaborate with others, and build things that can be of immense public service. Thank you for
        checking out this page. Please feel free to reach out, it would be really great to meet you!</p>
