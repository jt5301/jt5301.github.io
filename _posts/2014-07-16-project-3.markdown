description: A web app that lets you find any movies listed on IMDB, and give it a thumbs up or thumbs down. Originally made using Express, I ended up implementing GraphQL as an exercise in learning how to implement GraphQL and Apollo for serving data. The final iteration of this project is made with React, GraphQL/Apollo and MongoDB, with MaterialUI for styling.
