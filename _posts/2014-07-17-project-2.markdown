description: The final project I made at the end of my time at Fullstack Academy with a group of three others. Accountabuddy is a mobile productivity app that allows users to track tasks to complete, with the added motivation and encouragement of having a pet to take care of. We also wanted to add some social functionality such as real-time chat to add other ways for users to keep accountable to their chores. Created with React Native, Node.js, Express and Firebase.
